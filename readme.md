Assumptions:
- Drivers/Customers don't move once their position has been assigned
- San Francisco is a rectangular grid (things like water or nearby cities may be used in the simulation)
- Drivers will always take the most efficient route
- All driving is assigned on a first come, first served basis.  If there are ties, then the driver closest to the customer is given priority
- All trips take the exact estimate time (traffic, car problems, missing customer, unexpected delays are assumed to be nonexistent).  Pre-ride/post-ride times are nonexistent
- Assignment of rides are performed instantly (drivers are 100% responsive and take no breaks)
